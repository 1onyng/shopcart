## Sales Tax

This project allows a user to add items into a shopping cart and returns a receipt that calculates the sale price of each item(tax included) and total sales price.

### Installation

1. You will need to install node.js. Once done, you can use npm to install:

npm install

2. Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser:

npm start

### Technologies

* JavaScript
* React

### Design 

A main requirement for this application is that it accepts input for shopping baskets and returns a receipt. I am assuming that the app should behave similar to the shopping carts that are common with online retailers. React is an excellent front-end framework for this project because I expect many rerenders for a shopping cart, which React is fast and efficient at dealing with.
